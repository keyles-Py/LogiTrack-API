## Day 11 jan 2026

### On my first day learning and improving my backend developer skills I decided to work on a logistic project about deliveries, I started creating the ER diagram and logic design for the database:

### based on these diagrams, I created the models using Django and used them via the Django admin page also implemetating the logic to avoid assigning a delivery to a vehicle that is in maintenance.
